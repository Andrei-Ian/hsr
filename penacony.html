<h2 class="purple-text accent-2">Penacony</h2>
<p>The Planet of Festivities in the Asdana star system, also known as Land of the Dreams. A luxurious hotel positioned above the fathomless sky, Penacony is also a vacation spot where interstellar celebrities party the days away and the affluent from diverse words revel in lavish ventures. People flock here in search of dreams they've longed for or have already buried, and through Dreampools in the hotel are transported to a realm of dreams where everything can come true.

    Rarely do guests pay attention to Penacony's heavy past. A millennium ago, it was a frontier prison established by the IPC. Exiled prisoners must survive an arduous journey across vast distances to reach this location, and are then forced to take up a duty: To mend the leak through which memoria seeps into the galaxy. As they labor while being exposed to memoria, the prisoners gradually discovered themselves entering a captivating shared dream world, where they obtained a single shared desire — freedom.
    
    After the eruption of the Cancer of All Worlds, the ownership of the Frontier Prison changed hands. Historical records related to this struggle are scarce and often questionable. However, some accounts clearly state that with the assistance of various factions - including the Mourning Actors, the Masked Fools, the Nameless, and the Omen Vanguards - the prisoners emerged as the new rulers of this nascent realm. Sounds of discord could then periodically be heard during the subsequent times when it became a land of exiles. It was only when The Family descended and took control of the Dreamscape that Penacony experienced unparalleled and explosive prosperity, transforming into a renowned cosmic resort</p>

    Acheron is a Self-Annihilator, they are emanators of Nihility who will in time lose their whole self and meet their end but she is strong enough to resist that end instead making this affliction last for eternity. 

    She fights back by helping others avoid the trap of Nihility which likely means she's part of the Doctors of Chaos, a faction of Self-Annihilators that dedicate the time they have left to help others who suffer the same fate.</p>

<p>"A high-ranking executive of the IPC's Strategic Investment Department.
    A risk-taker, his constant smile makes it difficult for people to discern his true feelings."
    Kakavasha lived a harsh life. He grew up in the desolate desert without ever seeing his own reflection in a mirror or in the waters. Kakavasha's father and mother both died under the hands of Katicans, and death's gloom followed him everywhere he went, too. This is also why he mentioned that he's good at hide-and-seek - because he's had to learn how to hide from danger since youth. During that faithful Kakava, night of the downpour, his sister and all that remained of his clan decided to fight to the death against the Katicans with the "help" from the IPC. His sister said that his good fortune will ensure their success, and that so long as he lives, the blood of the Avgin will never run dry.
