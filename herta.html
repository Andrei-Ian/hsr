                <h2 class="purple-text accent-2">Herta Space Station</h2>
                <p>Not content with the laws of the common world, Herta of the Genius Society set her sights on the unexplained existences of the cosmos, expecting those distant mysteries to satisfy her curiosity. To this end, Herta led the establishment of a museum-like starship and launched it into orbit, starting the research to "seal all strange existences among the stars." That was how the famous Herta Space Station was born.

                    Nowadays, the space station possesses innumerable Curios and is a veritable space museum. A great number of researchers also live on the station. They continuously collect relics and Curios all over the cosmos, record their appearances and functions, establish systematic methods to observe and study them... ultimately finding even more confounding enigmas from their studies. That in fact, was Herta's initial goal.
                    
                    This large "collection" often attracts jealous eyes. Various forces watch from the shadows. Due to Herta's power, the space station had rarely experienced a real crisis, and the collection and investigation work continues to operate in an orderly manner.</p>

            <h5 class="purple-text accent-2">Material Control Zone</h5>
            <p>The Master Control Zone can be detached from the station, capable of traversing the Cosmos on its own. It serves as the brain of operations when attached to the main body of the space station. On both sides of the master control zone and at its entrance is a huge wall consisting of numerous screens for surveillance. This system offers visuals on everything happening on the parameter of the space station with no blind spot. The system also boasts a sniper platform with roadblocks, capable of handling unknown threats, and a defense projection platform that can generate an anti-gravity shield over the space station.</p>

            <h5 class="purple-text accent-2">Base Zone</h5>
            <p>The Base Zone is the core section between the two-stage structure separating the starship and the space station. It is the section where researchers partake in their primary daily activities. The reception center is located in the base zone, at the back of the space elevator. It is the first room to greet the station's visitors. Many people come here to see its splendor for themselves, but they are not allowed any further, and can only watch the proud researchers with admiration. The Medical Cabin is the medical facility and pride of the space station, said to be able to drag anyone back from the brink of death. Research projects in the station are always accompanied by unknown risks, and therefore the medical cabin is packed at all times.</p>

            <h5 class="purple-text accent-2">Storage Zone</h5>
            <p>The Storage Zone is used to house curios. Gigantic pathways can be found in the center, snaking through the upper and lower level rooms where different departments store their collections. The Gallery of Shadow is Madam Herta's personal gallery, sealed away all year round, and only Herta herself has access to entry. To the researchers, the gallery is no more than something to base their stories on, but it was opened by the Stellaron Hunters in order to place the Stellaron being stored there inside the Trailblazer during the Antimatter Legion attack.

            <h5 class="purple-text accent-2">Supply Zone</h5>
            <p>The Supply Zone is the logistics hub of the space station. It has all manner of resources stored within its confines, supervises an energy core, and its equipped with a fully established railway platform. It stands as an essential junction for operations and maintenance aboard the space station. If things ever got out of hand and the master control zone was doomed to be destroyed, researchers would take the evacuation route and rush towards the supply zone, where all the external relief ships are docked along the Railway Platform.

            <h5 class="purple-text accent-2">Seclusion Zone</h5>
            <p>The Seclusion Zone used to be a major research facility for cutting-edge experimentation, offering convenient conditions for high-risk experiments conducted between the shuttles, laboratories, and the greenhouse. The zone sealed off after Ruan Mei began to conduct her experiments, which resulted in a Swarm outbreak along with a clone of the Emanator of Propagation, Skaracabaz. The Trailblazer investigated this zone on Ruan Mei's behalf during one of her rare visits to the station, during which the clone emerged from the incubator and fought them. However, it died off after 56 seconds, unable to sustain its own existence. While the Swarm still has a small presence in the area, it is now primarily occupied by Ruan Mei's Creations, who mostly reside in the Breeding Ground and Pharmaceutical Room.
